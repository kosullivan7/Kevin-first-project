**Design**

This website is designed as a single page website broken down into three easily accessible sections. This is to give the website a more modern look and to keep the key information close together in one convenient location.

The priorities for the website are its products and its location. These are prominent on the landing page. The nav links on the header and back to top button near the footer are designed so the user can easily go to the desired location without much effort.

The contact us section contains a form where users can reserve a table or ask any relevant question directly to the business.

Showcasing the products is one of the main goals and this is done with the use of colourful photos with the use of text kept to a adequate minimum.

**Fonts and colour scheme –**

The colour theme is based on the dominant colour used on other cocktail bar websites. It is rgb 214, 152, 105. The colour has a relaxing feel to it and contrasts well with the images and text used on the page.

**Font –** The fonts used were imported from fontawesome and were Lato for the body and Oswald for the headings. The font colour was \#3a3a3a. This gave the website a modern look and made it easy for users to read amidst the background color and images.

**Images –** The images used were from the website pexels. The owners are credited in the credits section. High quality images were used and then compressed for better performance on smaller screens such as mobile phones. The tinypng website was used for this purpose.

**Text –** All text is written by the author.

**Features -**

**Navigation Bar –** The navigation bar is located at the top of the page.

-   It features three links; Home, Menu and Contact Us on the right hand side of the header. This is where the user would expect to find the main navigation links.
-   When a user hovers over the links the cursor changes to a finger pointing at the chosen link.
-   On the left hand side of the nav bar is the business name with a cocktail logo downloaded from the font awesome website. This helps to make the business name stand out more to the user and is visually more appealing than the name on its own.

    **Footer –**

-   The footer features the opening hours on the left hand side in a column format.
-   The centre of the footer has the social media links for the business. They are displayed in a horizontal fashion. The google maps link is located first so users can instantly click to see where exactly the bar is in relation to their current location.
-   The right hand side of the footer contains the address of the bar.
-   The footer is responsive with the opening hours sliding above the social media links. The social media icons are also displayed in a column on the smaller screen sizes with the business address sliding below.

    **Back to top arrow –**

-   This is located just before the footer and underneath the drinks menu. The user on clicking it will be returned to the top of the web page.

    **Hero Image –**

-   This is located below the header and navigation links. It is a picture of the bar with various bottles of beverages on shelves. I felt it would look better to have an image of the business on its own without any overlying text. It also leads into the welcome section of the website.

    **Welcome section –**

-   Below the hero image there is a text area welcoming the user to the site and giving a brief description of the newly opened business. There is a background image of a bartender making cocktails to promote the type of bar Donoghues is and emphasise the training of the bar staff in making appealing cocktails. A dark overlay was added to make the image more subtle and make the white text stand out more on the page.

**Menu –**

-   This section of the page features a gallery of the range of cocktail beverages offered and is displayed in rows of four drinks on larger screens. On smaller screens this reduces to just one item for better responsivity. The colourful images also seem to stand out that bit more as a result giving the webpage an appealing, bright colourful feel.

    **Contact Us –**

-   This area of the page is located directly beneath the menu section. A form is added where a user can enter their name, email address and write in the comment section. Reservations or general enquiries can be requested from here. The various fields change colour when hovered over. The name and email fields change to a light green with the send button changing to a maroon colour. This makes it easier for a user to interact with the form.
-   In order to successfully send a message the user must first fill in the name and email fields. On pressing send the user is brought to the code institute form dump to show that the message was correctly submitted.

**Possible future features –**

-   As the business is expected to expand there is scope for the bar to begin offering a food menu.
-   Users could have the option of subscribing to a monthly newsletter detailing any upcoming gigs or events at the bar. Also any changes to the menu such as introducing particular themes for the month could also be advertised in this way.
-   A separate page within the site for functions such as parties could also be introduced with pictures of the function room and the various services offered on booking.

**Languages used –**

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) was used for the basic website design. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was used to style the website.

**Technologies Used**

-   [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the text fonts (Lato and Oswald), social media icons and back to top arrow.
-   [Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3+Abbeygate+Street+Upper,+Galway,+H91+F58E/@53.2733642,-9.0544974,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x485b96e54561d995:0x76cb494f8cc735a6!8m2!3d53.2733642!4d-9.0523034) was used for the find us area of the footer. A map link to the business was provided.
-   [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) was used to compress or down-size the images to improve performance particularly on mobile screens.

**Testing of web page**

-   [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used during the project and some small syntax errors were detected and corrected. The final test showed no errors or defects.

-   [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to test the styling of the page. Again some small syntax errors were detected and corrected. The final test showed no errors.

    ![Graphical user interface, text, application, email Description automatically generated](media/bab0359c8044e570bd309c5834ec5040.png)

-   Lighthouse in chrome developer tools was used to test performance and detected some issues with jpegs loading on mobile devices. This was corrected with compressing the images using the tinypng website.

**Responsiveness –**

The website was tested on chrome, firefox, safari and mozilla. No issues were detected. I also tested the website in [responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) to see how it performed on various devices including tablets, Samsung phones and iphones. Chrome developer tools was used to test breaking points and for determining media queries at smaller screen sizes for tablets and mobile phones.

**Manual Testing –**

All links in the page were checked and the completed form was submitted to Code Institute form dump.

The following links were manually tested and passed;

Navigation bar –

-   Home, Menu and Contact Us links.
-   The nav links respond to smaller screen sizes by moving beneath the logo which stays at the top of the page.

    ![Graphical user interface, application, Word, PowerPoint Description automatically generated](media/685f7f8d4b96c07227a17dc8ef5dabab.png)

    Footer –

-   The social media icons link to three social media accounts
-   The map link opens to the business location

    ![Graphical user interface, application, map Description automatically generated](media/d3d76f613f3d6d80e2d4b86b530f0b7f.png)

-   The footer is responsive with the opening hours appearing on top of the social media icons and map location. The business address is then slid underneath as the screen size is reduced.

![Graphical user interface, table Description automatically generated with medium confidence](media/a74e15397a516b9d3aaf0e48849705ff.png)

-   The back to top arrow works correctly.

The contact us form submits to the code institute form dump. Also it does not submit unless all required fields are completed.

**Bugs**

-   The header, footer and menu did break at smaller screen resolutions. This was addressed with media queries.
-   The performance of the site reduced on mobile phones due to the size of the image files used. This was corrected by using the website tinypng to compress the images.
